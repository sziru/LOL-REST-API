# League Of Legends Champions API

## Introduction

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis. My graphic card was broken. So I couldnâ€™t play LOL (League of Legends) and I joined coding bootcamp. I didnâ€™t have enough time to play the game. I missed all the champions. Creating LOL REST api to get the championsâ€™ information is the way to see them. This is why I choose the data.

This api provides simple information about LOL champions. I used data from https://github.com/ngryman/lol-champions to build api server. This api supports HTTP GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE. Please be careful manipulate the data. the data is stored in firebase. I'm newb using firebase and I failed to deploy my serverðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. Please wait until completing the deploy. Now the api provides champions basic information **ONLY**

## Resource Lists and Pagination

Calling champions endpoint with **start** and **offset** you can get a paginated list of available resources. Without start and offset, it returns all championsâ€™ information.

**start** is the beginning index of the list.
**offset** is the number of the champions.

### GET /api/v1/champions/?start=20&offset=20

## Champions

### GET /api/v1/champions/

Get all the champions' information.
